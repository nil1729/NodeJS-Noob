## Learning NodeJS

* Simple Tasks done by me while learning `Node JS`.
---
#### Task 1 ( Notes App )
* This is a basic app using only Node JS. It is about how can I interact with `File System` by Javascript Language.
---
#### Task 2 ( Weather App )
* This is the first App using Express and Node JS. By this task I learned how can `fetch` data from APIs and display then in client Side using NodeJS. Here I use `Weather Stack` api for fetching current Weather Status of a particular Place. 
---
#### Task 3 ( Image Uploader using `Multer` )
* This is very important. By completing this task We can learn how can upload a image in Server Side and saved them in local `File System`.
---
#### Task 4 ( Chat App using Socket.io )
* Nowadays this is very trending technology. Here I learn how use websockets and how to connect Server Side and Client Side together. 
---
#### Task 5 ( Vidjot using Passport Authentication )
* This is a fully functional app using Express as a Server. Here I learn how to use `Passport` for authentication, how to override the request using `method-override`, about flash messages using `Connect-flash` and the main thing how to interact with Database (MongoDB) in Backend.
---
#### Task 6 ( CSV import using `Multer` and `csvtojson` module )
* This is a basic implementation by which we can upload a bunch of data into Database by uploading a CSV file.

## NodeJS Noob

- Understanding and Learning about `Node JS`.

---

#### Task 1 ( Notes App )

- This is a basic app using only Node JS. It is about how can I interact with `File System` by Javascript Language.

---

#### Task 2 ( Weather App )

- This is the first App using Express and Node JS. By this task I learned how can `fetch` data from APIs and display then in client Side using NodeJS. Here I use `Weather Stack` api for fetching current Weather Status of a particular Place.

---

#### Task 3 ( Image Uploader using `Multer` )

- This is very important. By completing this task We can learn how can upload a image in Server Side and saved them in local `File System`.

---

#### Task 4 ( Chat App using Socket.io )

- Nowadays this is very trending technology. Here I learn how use websockets and how to connect Server Side and Client Side together.

---

#### Task 5 ( Vidjot using Passport Authentication )

- This is a fully functional app using Express as a Server. Here I learn how to use `Passport` for authentication, how to override the request using `method-override`, about flash messages using `Connect-flash` and the main thing how to interact with Database (MongoDB) in Backend.

---

#### Task 6 ( CSV import using `Multer` and `csvtojson` module & CSV export using `json2csv` module )

- This is a basic implementation by which we can upload a bunch of data into Database by uploading a CSV file.

---

#### Task 7 ( File Uploade on MongoDB GridFS )

- This is a Simple Express App that uploads Files on MongoDB, here we don't store any files on our local File System. It can be used in Production Level Applications.

- Here I use `Multer` for uploading files as usual. Also I used `multer-gridfs-storage` to store files directly on MongoDB GridFS Bucket and `gridfs-stream` for dealing CRUD operations with files on MongoDB GridFS.

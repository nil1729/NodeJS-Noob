# SMS Sending App

### About SMS Sending App

- This App is built using node.js and [`Twilio api`](https://www.twilio.com/).

### How do I get set up?

#### Configuration needed for run this Code:

- For Sending SMS through `twilio api`, you must have a `twilio api` key. First of all Sign Up on [`twilio`](https://www.twilio.com/) and take your api key.
- `Twilio` can only send SMS to verified Caller ID which verified by an OTP send from `Twilio`.
- This App is built using my `API` key and `AUTH` token.
- Here I sent the `POST` request by using `fetch api` not by any `form`.
